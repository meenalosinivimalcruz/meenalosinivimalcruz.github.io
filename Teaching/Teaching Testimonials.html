  I took IT 1130 with Dr. Cruz during the Fall 2023 semester. This was my second atempt at this course, as I had taken it before, 
  online, but was unable to complete it. Clearly, in-person classes are beter suited to me than online courses.
   Dr. Cruz has an amazingly broad understanding of all IT-related subjects and translates that knowledge effec􀆟vely to her students. 
   Her delivery is fun and comprehensive, and she never hesitates to give addi􀆟onal aten􀆟on to students that need further clarifica􀆟on. I believe I will have at least three more classes with Dr. Cruz in my IT curriculum, and I am definitely looking forward to all of them.

        Hello Professor Cruz, I was in your fall IT-1430-B @ 9:30 a.m . After having your class it
        made me realize how much I love creating and designing websites! I never gave you a proper
        thank you for being an amazing professor, also a question I have to ask do you know if there
        are offers on this campus to do more with web development? I asked my advisor, but he only
        gave me the run around and I wondered since you had a class for it you would have some

really take the time to make sure everyone is understanding what they are
learning. I really liked how multiple times while presenting if asked, she would
kindly slow down if she was moving too fast. She always responds to her emails

After taking Web Development with you I have learned so much from not knowing anything
about web development to knowing how to create a whole webpage. I have learned how to
make tables with and without Javascript. I have learned about HTML and connecting it to a
CSS style sheet. I also learned how to create specific colors on my background and
learned about the color wheel. The videos in this class helped me so much that when I didn't
understand something I could go back and watch it later. Dr. Cruz, I appreciated all your help
and I am excited to be doing Data Programming with you soon you are a great teacher.

semester of website development. I truly appreciate how wellorganized
your course is, and I want to thank you for making it
engaging. The manner this course was taught inspired me to
study more as a student, and you should be fully credited for it.
The course topic was indeed challenging, but you made it easier
for students like myself who are hesitant to contact professors
frequently to seek assistance from you through folio chat and
office hours. Additionally, I want to thank you for enabling
students to arrive early and complete the exam at their own
pace. Last but not least, I want to say thanks for publishing
instructional videos on Folio.

Dr. Cruz is a great teacher. She thoroughly covers each and every topic that is taught. The
class is very organized and the topics are reiterated throughout the course to make sure
you have a deep understanding. We do lots of labs to practice the material that we learn.
Dr. Cruz also encourages us to learn and experiment with code outside of the classroom.
Dr. Cruz is very knowledgeable and will answer any questions that you have. Dr. Cruz is an
amazing professor and if you are interested in learning to code I would highly recommend
her.

I have learned much more than I ever thought I would from this class. At the beginning of this
class, I was very skeptical as I had not done much with IT. Professor Cruz went out of her way to
make sure that each student received what they needed and understood the content. Professor
Cruz challenged me mental to be able to think through problems; evaluating and fixing issues
myself. Not only was this class a good challenge but also Professor Cruz encouraged questions and
class participation. I have enjoyed this class and appreciate the time Professor Cruz took to make
this content engaging and easy to comprehend.

Thank you for this semester. This is my second class I have taken with you. I have learned a
lot. You always make the time to make sure your students have a solid understanding of the
material. Your ability to work with multiple students on a variety of issues is refreshing. It is a
great feeling to have a professor that is willing and understanding that students have lives
outside of school, and actually care about their success. I am looking forward to having more
classes with you in the future. You are appreciated, thank you again.

I came into Dr. Cruz's class having never written any lines of code. At the end of the course I
was able to develop and apply specific coding solutions to real world applications. She always
provided us with immediate coding examples for each topic we discussed in class. This
provided me with a better understanding of the material. Dr. Cruz always makes sure that
students understand the lectures. She will take the time to review the topic, meet with the
student after class, or post a video on the topic. I look forward to taking my further
programming classes with her.

Being that I am a Health Science major, I never understood why I had to take an IT course. So, you can imagine myinterest in the material prior to the first day of class. However, your teaching is amazing. The fact that you allow opennotes for your exams, extra credit and provided me the opportunity on how to create a website from scratch with colorfulbackgrounds, media query, and etc. If I could I would spread the word about how great a professor you are.

  Dr. Cruz’s passion for teaching was clear from the first day of class. She has a thorough understanding of the class
concepts but more importantly has a genuine interest in the success of her students. She created additional presentations
and videos to supplement the standard course materials and explained everything in detail in the classes. She also
patiently took us step-by-step through the labs and answered any questions. She set the expectations of what we need to
learn, and we are given a homework and quizzed consistently every week to make sure we are keeping up. I recommend
any student to take a course with Dr. Cruz!

I learned so much in my class with Dr. Cruz. She is an expert in her field and was able to teach the class in a way that
broke down the more difficult concepts in a simple way. I would always watch her Youtube videos of the material before I
would read the chapter of anything due and found that this was the best way to digest the material. Her class was very
organized and she was always willing to break down into detail anything we would have questions about. I would
recommend anyone who has the opportunity to take Dr. Cruz classes she teaches. You will learn the material very
effectively and the classes are fun and engaging.

  After taking three separate courses with you, I can say without hesitation that you definitely put a lot of work into making sure that we as students excel. You provide us with exactly what we need to succeed in each assignment, are open to discussion and willing to help us out whenever the opportunity arises, and are very encouraging when commenting on our work in general.
  This has become especially apparent through online teaching, as you seem to be doing everything you can to communicate with us; online meeting sessions, email contact, and even hour-long videos in which you elaborate on the week’s lesson so your students can better understand it.
   The amount of detail you put into explaining each lesson has ended up teaching me more than what I would ever expect to learn from a single semester. To be honest, you’re probably the only professor I know who could teach me three separate programming languages in just 90 days.
   The lab sessions you have us participate in during class periods help keep each meeting hands-on and interactive, and the programs we create out of them provide us reference for when we start working on the more serious projects in the class.
   The last three courses I’ve taken with you I’ve often regarded as some of my favorites, because not only are they flexible and easy to manage, but they also keep my own motivation up and allow me to learn about a lot of obscure topics that I wouldn’t be able to easily learn anywhere else.
   I don’t really know what else to say here, besides… thank you for everything so far! I appreciate every minute of your time you dedicate to helping us as students, and I am excited to see it continue in the future!

My Computer Science degree from Keene State College would not be the same without Meenalosini Vimal Cruz. Professor Cruz spearheaded many of the advanced Computer Science classes offered at Keene State as well as offered research projects for Computer Science majors.

This is simply a letter of gratitude for your enduring support over the past year. I was lucky to have someone with your skillset join the computer science faculty. And with my previous interest in data science, I knew you’d be a good resource.
 But I could not have imagined the opportunity to work so heavily in research. After conducting what is coming up on a year of research in the subject, I now know it’s what I would like to do long-term.
I foresee myself becoming a lifelong developer and advocate of AI. And with all the things I’ve learned and accomplished in the past year, I finally feel like I’m in a good place to do so. This, again, is thanks to you and our collaborative research.
I hope that publishing will reflect well on me, so I can attend graduate school for data science after next year. I also hope that the INBRE presentation goes well and we can continue our research throughout my last year at Keene State!
I look forward to new unexpected data science challenges,

Being a first-generation student can be hard. You'll be going into the unknown and into a lot of new stuff you'll be learning about. Dr.Cruz, has been a major help for my field of interest in computer science.

I will start by saying Professor Cruz has an unbelievable level of experience in the field of the class I’ve taken with her so far, ISCS 150. She is very succinct with descriptions and explanations and efficiently utilizes a marker and whiteboard to efficient results during lectures. I am glad she utilizes tutors so we can occasionally get more feedback outside of class. Professor Cruz has done a great job making an extremely daunting and unapproachable subject a bit easier to get started with. I’m glad I took her class early so I had a chance to see Computer Science as a possible path for me to take during college. I really like the concept of presenting our work periodically to the class as an assignment. Professor Cruz has fostered a really cooperative and positive environment and did not impede the class train of thought with any regimented oversight, which allowed students to work together to solve problems with her assistance.

I really enjoy the use of the video lectures, as well as how you record every class in case someone misses it and needs to catch up.  Also, I enjoy your assignments as they are still a challenge in terms of creativity and applying what we learn, but like I said, it’s easy to follow the instructions and it’s great to know exactly what we have to do.

I find this course very new and exciting. It is my first time taking this course on website design and construction. I was nervous at the beginning of the class because I am not from a computer science background and the whole concept of HTML was new to me. However, Dr. Cruz made my learning experience much more comfortable and worth learning. I really admire Dr. Cruz's relationship with her students. She is very student-oriented, and her class is one of the most interactive classes I ever have. Even on zoom, this is the only class where students feel comfortable interacting and keeping their camera on.  Her teaching motive is not to make students suffer from hard grading or hard material but to actually teach them. She ensures every student understands the learning materials and helps her student with proper guidance, constructive feedback, and tutors.  She gives multiple chances in taking quizzes, which allows students to focus on learning rather than getting good grades.  She is very invested and well prepared in her class, from making a video presentation to PowerPoint slides. And I am really grateful for her motivating and friendly nature towards students.

Dr. Vimal Cruz is one of the most passionate educators I had the privilege of learning from during my time at Keene State College, a fact made ever more apparent amidst the COVID-19 outbreak where she spent countless hours preparing online classes with step-by-step instructions, video tutorials, and links to numerous outside resources to help us better understand the principals and concepts of the course curriculum.
 I had classes with Dr. Vimal Cruz in both her first and third year at KSC, and saw a marked difference in both her confidence and adaptation of her teaching style to best accommodate the needs of her students. Not only did Dr. Vimal Cruz motivate students to participate in class, an impressive feat in a climate where most students don't say a word in classroom discussions,
she also encouraged students to help one another - which as we know is a fantastic way to learn. I would absolutely recommend Computer Science students take classes with Dr. Vimal Cruz.

I enjoy having different aspects of the weekly homework due at different times during the week and not all on one day because it forces me to get work done on different days and not procrastinate which is sometimes necessary.

 I have enjoyed all of Dr. Cruz's classes I have taken. Her classes typically include equal parts lecture and hands on practice which leads to better retention of the material for the students.
 The work isn't always easy, but she is accessible for additional help if needed. I would take classes with Dr. Cruz again.
